# Ride-Sharing-app-Data-analysis
The Ride-Sharing App Data Analysis project provides valuable insights and actionable recommendations for improving the performance and user experience of a ride-sharing application. This project combines the power of SQL, Power BI, and Excel to extract, transform, analyze, and visualize large datasets generated by the ride-sharing app.

Data Extraction: Extract and collect relevant data from various sources within the ride-sharing app's ecosystem, including user profiles, trip history, driver information, and user feedback.

Data Transformation: Cleanse, preprocess, and transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, data quality checks, and data normalization.

Data Analysis: Utilize SQL queries to perform in-depth analysis on the transformed data. Explore trends, patterns, and anomalies in user behavior, trip statistics, and driver performance.

Visualization: Create visually appealing and informative dashboards using Power BI to present key findings and insights. These dashboards will help stakeholders gain a holistic view of the ride-sharing app's performance.
